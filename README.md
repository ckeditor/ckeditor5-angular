Note that the `package.json` file used in the main repository isn't published on npm (the production one is present in [`src/ckeditor/package.json`](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-angular/blob/master/src/ckeditor/package.json)).

## Contributing

> [!NOTE]
> This project requires **pnpm v10** or higher. You can check your version with `pnpm --version` and update if needed with `npm install -g pnpm@latest`.

After cloning this repository, install necessary dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### The structure of the repository

This repository contains the following code:

* `./src/ckeditor` contains the implementation of the `<ckeditor>` component,
* `./src/app` is a demo application using the component.

**Note:** The [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-angular) contains a [packaged component](#packaging-the-component) only.

### Testing the component (demo)

To open the demo application using the component, run:

```bash
pnpm run start
```

To test it in production, use:

```bash
pnpm run start --configuration production
```

To run unit tests, use:

```bash
pnpm run test
```

To run e2e tests, run:

```bash
# Prepare the server.
pnpm run start
# Then, start tests.
pnpm run test:e2e
```

To run coverage tests, run:

```bash
pnpm run coverage
```

Play with the application and make sure the component works properly.

## Releasing package

CircleCI automates the release process and can release both channels: stable (`X.Y.Z`) and pre-releases (`X.Y.Z-alpha.X`, etc.).

Before you start, you need to prepare the changelog entries.

1. Make sure the `#master` branch is up-to-date: `git fetch && git checkout master && git pull`.
1. Prepare a release branch: `git checkout -b release-[YYYYMMDD]` where `YYYYMMDD` is the current day.
1. Generate the changelog entries: `pnpm run release:prepare-changelog`.
	* You can specify the release date by passing the `--date` option, e.g., `--date=2025-06-11`.
	* By passing the `--dry-run` option, you can check what the script will do without actually modifying the files.
	* Read all the entries, correct poor wording and other issues, wrap code names in backticks to format them, etc.
	* Add the missing `the/a` articles, `()` to method names, "it's" -> "its", etc.
	* A newly introduced feature should have just one changelog entry â€“ something like "The initial implementation of the FOO feature." with a description of what it does.
1. Commit all changes and prepare a new pull request targeting the `#master` branch.
1. Ping the `@ckeditor/ckeditor-5-platform` team to review the pull request and trigger the release process.
